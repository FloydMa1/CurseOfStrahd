## Backstory
Aromorn grew up in a noble household under the cousin of Duchess Morwen of Daggerford. Still, in his teen years, he has not dealt with a lot of trauma, despite his mother dying on his day of birth (which he has no recollection of and his father does not speak about). His mom is Elven (Name: Marta Morwen/Lansten, People: Vistani, Connection: Madame Eva’s group), and his father is Human (Name: Harley Morwen, People: Nobleman of Daggerford, Connection: Cousin of Duchess Morwen, On the council of Daggerford). In his upbringing, he got a lot of attention from his father when available but because of his profession, he was home after working at the council (which was late in the evening). This means his governess mostly raised him. He was an elderly elven man who, in his olden days he trained the new coming soldiers in the Daggerford army. In the times when Aromorn was not studying and learning about noble duties, nature, and history, he was trained by his governess in the nearby woods of Daggerford. This was always communicated openly to his father and was approved by him. He mostly trained with Bow and Arrow, but some close combat fighting was also covered in his training. This was never against any creatures or enemies, but always against unliving tree trunks or aiming targets. He has always been treated as a nobleman wherever he went, but he always got slightly annoyed when he did. Going to the local spots and meddling with peasants was his time-passing hobby. As a kid he always used to hear stories about an ancient war fought between the city of Daggerford and the invasive forces of an unknown origin. Even though the forces were fended off they spoke of soldiers that were sensitive to the light and humans that can turn into wolves that can tear people limb from limb. This is a common nightmare among children that reside in Daggerford (This is why his favored enemy is Undead). Being trained since he was able to understand why he needs to be able to defend himself he wanted to prove to his governess that you can solve conflicts or problems without fighting. After the council had met requesting a caravan to seek out these “annoyances” in the vicinity of Daggerford Aromorn was eager to get out of his noble position, and his constant studying. Because he wanted to convince his governess (Name: Hubert Strayhound) by going on this caravan and resolving the annoyance. 
The warning he must tell the disturbance goes as follow:  "You've been pestering our city for days now and it is time for you to leave. You must be gone before sundown otherwise there will be consequences."

When he was 10 (in elven years) he came across a young puppy of sorts. First thought it being a dog made Aromorn want to keep it and raise it as his own. Later after he got permission from his father and governess it soon became clear that this was no dog he was raising but instead a Wolf. But nonetheless, this wolf had no tendencies to kill or attack anything that he wasn’t allowed to attack since the training with the governess was also training and hunting times for Gorlock.

Underneath his armor, he has simplistic trousers with a white t-shirt that looks like it constantly gets dirty by being in the woods rolling and moving around. He carries a Longbow on the back together with a quiver for his green wooded arrows. On both sides of his hips, he carries two sheathed short swords angled to be drawn at any time. He wears leather-strapped boots. His shoulder-length brown hair looks like it is freshly cut and cleaned on a weekly basis.
