## Backstory
She was raised in a pretty normal wood elf community. She was a jeweler. But she got bored with life there so she left to find adventure. She decided to take up rogue skills because of an interest in lockpicking she had several decades ago, but she fell into assassinry on accident through her first couple of quests. One of these quests involved the stealing of a certain magical item that belonged to Rosie Valar from Waterdeep. She was hired to steal a magical item that could turn water into wine. But the mission ended up going sideways and she accidentally killed Rosie by throwing her dagger(out of a jumpy reaction when she caught her snooping around) right through her carotid wich made a big bloody mess without many traces of who the killer was and how they could find her. After the people that hired her (Nobleman from Daggerford) she quickly fell into the assassination business after the rumor about an assassination of a high noblewoman got out. 

For one of her assassination quests, she got the request to take care of a nuisance outside of Daggerford. She is traveling in a common people carriage together with one other cloaked figure. The carriage looks like a typical horse with a wagon cart that holds some boxes and has an open roof. Within it is food and some water.
