## Backstory
Ferris grew up in a small village outside of Waterdeep. He lived there with his Mom, not knowing his dad. Growing up he had a dream to become the best Wizard in Waterdeep, after years of hard work and growing up he finally got in the Wizard Academy of Waterdeep. But soon he realized how hard it was to be a wizard and how to control spells. He quickly fell behind and got lost in the work that he had to do. Soon after he fell behind on the social aspect with other kids. And in the end, he got kicked out because he "could never be a good spellcaster." Soon after he returned home to his mother who had been left behind when moving to Waterdeep. He found his mother to be overcome by illness. Soon after she passed away leaving Ferris alone in the world. Rather quickly after his mom's death he started believing in what she always believed in: [[The Morninglord]]. The goddess of the night. So he took it upon himself to join one of the local churches and started praying. He believed that the divine power would help him along the way. Soon after he began praying and advocating for the church he realized that he was gifted, not in a social manner, nor in a physical manner. But more in a divine manner. With the touch of his fingers and a blessing spoken, he could help wounded and sickened children across town. Soon after word got out, he got put in the special group in the church that travels around on "missions" and advocate for the church. Going around and helping people in exchange and as a good marketing strategy. A few weeks later he came to Daggerford, where he was tasked to help Harley Morwen his son(Aromorn Morwen) not get hurt or harmed on his way to seek out and solve this "Annoyance" that is bothering the city.
