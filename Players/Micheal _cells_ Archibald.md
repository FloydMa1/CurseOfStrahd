## Backstory
Micheal was raised by both of his parents in a village north of Daggerford. A small village with not a lot of people. It did however have one church, the church of the Morninglord. Both of his parents were believers and made Micheal believe too. For a while he did, but soon after both of his parents were brutally slaughtered during a robbery in Daggerford. They were there on business for the church. Soon after they got returned to Micheal he buried them and had to learn how to survive on his own. Quickly as he grew older he realized: "If the [[The Morninglord|Morninglord]] were real and had a plan for everyone, why, why was his plan to kill my parents?" After this realization a certain power came over him, it felt and still feels like a burning fire within him. He grew taller, wider, and stronger. He wondered why and how, so he went to countless doctors all saying its something divine and that they cant help him. But Micheal did not care, he was glad he had this power, he felt like all his years of suffering and surviving got rewarded. 

After a while of traveling and searching, a cleric(worshipper of The Morninglord) spoke to him. This cleric made it clear that he believed The Morninglord had blessed him with powers and such. Michael refuses to believe this, he believes its because of his own effort. But it has not been clear how and why he has these powers(side quest).

A good while after exploring his powers and fetching some coin for doing basic guarding duties and such he was contacted by the council of Daggerford. They have requested him to be a third-party guard in resolving a "disturbance" near Daggerford. He is supposed to be there in case a fight breaks out. He was hired to protect Aromorn Morwen in case of emergencies.
