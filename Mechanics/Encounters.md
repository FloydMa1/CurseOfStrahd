Dangers abound in the land of Barovia. Check for a random encounter after every 30 minutes that the adventurers spend on the roads or in the wilderness (don't check if they have already had two random encounters outdoors in the past 12 hours).

If the characters are on a road, an encounter occurs on a roll of 5 or lower on a d20.
If the characters are in the wilderness, an encounter occurs on a roll of 10 or lower on a d20. If an encounter occurs, roll on the daytime or the night-time encounter table, depending on the time, or have Strahd's spies appear (see the "Strahd's Spies" sidebar).
