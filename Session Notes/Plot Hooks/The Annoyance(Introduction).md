## The Dancing Fire
Stanimir introduces himself as the "Blind one" and welcomes the characters to his camp. If they deliver Duchess Morwen's warning, read: Stanimir laughs. "Don't worry. We have no wish to make enemies of Lady Morwen. I have a story to tell all of you. First, you listen, then we go."

If the characters agree to hear Stanimir's story, he invites them to gather around the fire and hear his tale: Stanimir fills his mouth with wine, then spits into the fire. The flames turn from orange to green. As they dance and sway, a dark shape appears in the bonfire's core. "We come from an ancient land whose name is long forgotten-a land of kings. Our enemies forced us from
our homes, and now we wander the lost roads." The dark shape in the fire takes the form of a man being knocked from his horse, a spear piercing his side.

Stanimir continues. "One night, a wounded soldier staggered into our camp and collapsed. We nursed his terrible injury and quenched his thirst with wine. He survived. When we asked him who he was, he wouldn't say. All he wanted was to return home, but we were deep in the land of his enemies. We took him as one of our own and followed him back toward his homeland. His
enemies hunted him. They said he was a prince, yet we didn't give him up, even when their assassins fell upon us like wolves." Deep in the bonfire, you see the dark figure standing
with a sword drawn, fighting off a host of shadowy shapes. "This man of royal blood fought to protect us, as we protected him. We bore him safely to his home, and he thanked us. He said, 'I owe you my life. Stay as long as you wish, leave when you choose, and know that you will
always be safe here."' The figure in the dancing fire vanquishes its final foe, then disperses in a cloud of smoke and embers. Stanimir's face becomes a somber mask. "A curse has befallen our noble prince, turning him into a tyrant. We alone have the power to leave his domain. We've traveled far and wide to find heroes such as yourselves to end our dread lord's curse and put his troubled soul to rest. Our leader, Madam Eva, knows all. She resides in the Tser Pool camp"

These Vistani refuse to speak the name of their "dread lord" and provide no additional information. If the characters press them for details, the Vistani reply, "Madam Eva has the answers you seek."

After a while of talking to Stanimir the start to feel a charming sensation come from the fire. And before they know it they fall asleep.

"After a foggy night of sleep, they wake up in a garden, not a lively green garden but a dark grey and musty garden. No weapons, no armor only nightgowns. No sign of Trally and Trolly. Looking around you are surrounded by a metal gate much like common fence gates in front of houses. As they look around they stand in front of a tall building with no color except for the color gray. In front of it at the doors, they see two children standing there, one slightly taller than the other."

The smaller child sings a lullaby: "Don't go out into the foggy mists, or you won't come home and you won't be missed."

"And indeed as you look around you can see a mist creeping at the fence, and you swear it almost looks alive."

If the characters try and talk to the children Rose says: "There is a monster in our house! Please help us..."
