#Sessionnotes 
Session 3: The burial of the burgomaster.

Current location: [[Chruch (E5)|Church]]
This session will be starting with the combat of the son of Donovich from the church of Barovia. The son, Doru is a [[Monsters and Creatures#Vampire Spawn|vampire spawn]]. He returned to his father like this after a wizard in black robes lured him to the north side of [[Barovia#Lake Zarovich(L)|Lake Zarovich]]. 

They have two options: They kill Doru, and Donovich will weep and not help them further. Or they restrain Doru and help him in a way and he will recount his actions that led him to his demise.

After they are either free to bury the burgomaster themselves or Donovich will help them if they did not kill Doru.

After burying the Burgomaster the players level up.

Bildraths's mercantile is on high alert. This means that Bildreth's bodyguard is continuously taking patrol in and around the shop. If any signs of break-in show to Bildrath or Perriwimple they will throw the characters out.

## Progress
The characters leveld up and got to bury the burgomaster and saved Doru and Donovich. Doru now remains in the undercroft and Donovich feeds him regularly.

The characters were planning a heist on the Bildrath's mercantile but they got distracted and took a short rest in the Tavern. Now the new character entered that will stirr the group up.
