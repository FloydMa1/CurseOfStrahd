[[The Annoyance(Introduction)]]
[[Tser Pool Encampment|Madame Eva's card-reading session]]

## Introductions
"All of you dreaming, a dream of a castle. A dream you all fear, and have been for days now. To the point of not wanting to fall asleep. Dark skies and danger around. With it, you have always heard an old lady's voice: "Your destiny awaits, seek the blind one, he will show you the way to me. And I will tell you where your destiny leads." But unlike the other times you dreamed this dream, this night you all wake up with a card in your hand. And in a carriage where you took an unexpected nap."

Do [[Tser Pool Encampment|Madame Eva's card-reading session]] and assign one card to each player. 

"As dark skies and lurking destiny await a group of unknown characters on their way to resolve an "issue". Pretty close to the city of Daggerford, a city some of you are familiar with and know that it is a city filled with power and rich noblemen. As the skies grow darker and nighttime arrives we can see some shallow lanterns beginning to flicker in the carriages. As we take a closer look at the leading carriage we can see a well-defined and more noble-looking carriage, within it, we see a figure. This figure looks to be filled with anticipation, concern, and enthusiasm."

Introduce: [[Aromorn Morwen]]

"As we zoom out of the well-furnished and cleanly kept carriage of Aromorn we look back to the two other carriages. The middle carriage. This carriage is a darker wood and has some unknown carvings upon it. It has a closed roof just like the nobleman's carriage. Within it, we can see some holy symbols carved into the wood(symbols of Morninglord). In this carriage, a hooded figure sits, with his hands clasped and words muttering."

Introduce [[Ferris "coins" Boons]]

"After the prayer has been finished we zoom out once more to the last and most scrappy-looking carriage. It's an open-roofed carriage with two small benches. In the carriage sits two figures, one hooded and the other not. Besides the figures, we see two sets of barrels, one with food and firewood and the other filled with water. We first look towards the figure with his golden hair out in the dark skies."

Introduce [[Micheal "cells" Archibald]]

"*Distant thunder rumbles* as the night becomes ever darker. As the light of the thunder flickers the hooded figure on this wagon pulls off her hood"

Introduce [[Zinyra Tree]]

"Looking out we start to slow down and you(Aromorn) can hear the familiar voice of Trolly: "We're here Trally! Stop the wagons." As the horses stop with a hint of unrest to them. All of you can see from your carriages a faint campfire lit in the distance. This is most likely the annoyance you were investigating and going to solve. A few moments pass as the group gathers and walks toward the 4 men sitting at the campfire. You notice that they have a peaceful and calm attitude to them."

As Aromorn speaks: "I have come to give you a warning. You've been pestering our city for days now and it is time for you to leave. You must be gone before sundown otherwise there will be consequences."

Read [[The Annoyance(Introduction)]]

After the events of the Death House, they get overwhelmed by fog and fall asleep once more. Read: "A dream comes upon you all. One you have had before, but this time stronger and more omnipotent. As you see once more a castle, a dark looming castle. One that frightens you and makes the hair stand up straight on your body. As lightning strikes in your dream, you enter a dark space with nothing around. A familiar voice enters the dream, the voice of an older lady who has talked to you before in a dream."

Madame Eva: "Your destiny awaits, seek the blind one, he will lead you to me. And I will tell you where your destiny leads."

Only to wake up on a lonesome road near Tser pool encampment awaited by a blind Vistani, the same that told the story.

[[Talkie Ring|The Talkie Rings]] have been found and are being worn by Zinyra.

The [[Haunted House (E7).pdf|Death house]] is now inactive and will not open to anyone anymore, if people try to investigate or look at it more read: "The house is giving off nothing but darkness. It feels as if the house was defeated and has now become no longer open to visitors."

The players made it out safely of Death house and Strahd has been satisfied, he has tested the new group of travelers well. And hopefully scared them. 

The players are now outside of the gates of Death house.
