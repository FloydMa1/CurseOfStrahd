Session Recap:
The boys have encountered and captured Ernst Larnak(they do not know his name) but released him. Ernst will return to Fiona Wachter to let her know they might be potential candidates.

The boys left off in the midst of the battle with the two vampire spawns(both 60 HP). They are currently at the [[Barovia#Luna River Crossroads(P)|Luna River Crossroads]] and wanted to head northwest towards [[|Lake Baratok]].

Strahd payed them a visit at this crossing to show some more of his power and play with Ferris and Micheal their friendship.

They ventured out to go towards [[The Wizards of Wines]]
