#Sessionnotes 
This session will be the beginning of the open adventure. We will start the players off in [[The Village of Barovia]] and teleport them to the [[Tser Pool Encampment]].

Main Events:
[[Tser Pool Encampment]]
[[Tser Pool Encampment#Madam Eva's Tent|Madame Eva's Tent]]

After the Events of the Death House, the players are greeted by the blind Vistani once again. As he leans against a dark wall across from where the players exited the gates of the Death House(Which is now inactive). The man known as Stanimir jumps to his feet with a joyful stride. As he is clapping and laughing read: "Ahahaha, my bad friends! I meant to teleport us to the camp... But I'm surprised that you survived in there! Well, anyway, she is waiting so c'mon. hurry up." As he points towards a very bland-looking carriage that sits next to the house he was leaning against. By the looks of it mainly used for traveling and transporting groups of people. 

If the players deny his request they hear: "Ugh c'mon, why do you gotta be so difficult. I didn't mean to put you in there."

If the players still deny his request Stanimir teleports the group in an instant to the [[Tser Pool Encampment]].

After the events of Madame Eva's Tent, the players are free to go, Stanimir is not able to teleport again today if the players ask. 


## Notes
The players have visited the Tser Pool encampment and have been told their destinies. The players accepted their fate and decided to fulfill the destiny that defies all evil. 

The players met:
Bard - The mysterious elven Vistani in the encampment who should have disappeared long ago.
Arik the Barkeep - A pudgy little man named Arik Lorensk (CN male human commoner) tends bar. Mindlessly, he cleans glasses, one after another. When they're all clean, he starts over. If he is spoken to, he takes orders for drinks in a dull, hollow voice. A small glass of wine costs 1 cp. A pitcher of wine costs 1 sp. After serving drinks, Arik returns to cleaning glasses. He ignores all attempts to question him.
[[Bildrath's Mercantile (E1)|Bildrath's Mercantile]] - They were fairly hostile towards him so he put up his defences slightly and scammed Ferris.

Currently, the players reside in the undercroft of the church in the Town trying to bury the deceased body of the Burgomaster. They talked to father Donovich and he led them to their starving vampire son. The players didn't explore anything else.
