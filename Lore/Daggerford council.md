The Daggerford council has sent an envaoy to speak to annoyances near the town. They have sent a caravan with it in case of emergencies or extra help. The council exists of: Duchess Morwen, Harley Morwen, Grubar Uluk and two other unknown characters that reside in Daggerford.

On this caravan are the player characters and two guards.

The guards are Trally (Half-Orc, Male) and Trolly (Half-Ord Male). They are brothers who work closely with the council and have earned a lot of trust within it. The guards know Damion's character because they have seen him around near the council bc his father is in the council.
