The Keepers of the Feather, a secret society of wereravens that opposes Strahd. Urwin's wife and business partner, Danika Dorakova (LG female human), is also a wereraven, as are their two sons, Brom and Bray. The boys have only 7 hit points each and, at ages eleven and nine, are too young to be effective combatants. At any given time, another 1d4 wereravens (members of the Keepers of the Feather) are present at the inn, either perched on the rooftop in raven form or huddled inside in human form. These wereravens are loyal friends of the Martikovs and help protect the inn. If the characters earn the trust of the wereravens in Vallaki, the Keepers of the Feather will watch their backs. The next time the characters get themselves in serious trouble, you can have a group of 1d4 wereravens show up to rescue or otherwise help them.
