"This large stockyard has several locked sheds along its periphery and lies adjacent to a roomy warehouse. A wooden sign above the front gate reads "Arasek Stockyard." Parked at the south end of the stockyard is a sturdy carnival wagon, its colorful paint peeling off. Faded lettering on its sides spells out the words "Rictavio's Carnival of Wonders." A heavy padlock secures the back door"

The stockyard is a general store and a facility where storage sheds can be rented. It is owned by a middleaged married couple, Gunther and Yelena Arasek (LG male and female commoners). They sell items from the Adventuring Gear table in the Player's Handbook that have a price of 25 gp or less, but at five times the price.

**Rictavio's CARNIVAL WAGON** 
The colorful half-elf bard Rictavio (see area [[Blue Water Inn(N2)|N2]]) paid Gunther and Yelena a generous amount of gold to watch his carnival wagon, no questions asked. If the characters approach the wagon, read:

"The wagon suddenly lurches, as though something big has thrown itself against the inside wall. You hear the cracking of wood, the scraping of metal, and the snarl of something inhuman. Upon closer inspection, you see that the sides of the wagon are spattered with dry blood. You also see an inscription on the wagon's door frame that reads, "I bring you from Shadow into Light!""

Rictavio carries the key to the wagon door. The lock can be picked but is rigged with a poison needle trap (see "Sample Traps" in chapter 5, "Adventure Environments," of the Dungeon Master's Guide). Inside the wagon is a saber-toothed tiger with 84 hit points. It is clad in specially fitted half plate (AC 17) and has been trained to hunt evil Vistani. The tiger recognizes Vistani by smell and, to a lesser extent, by the fancy garb they wear: This tiger has a challenge rating of 3. The wagon also contains the torn-up remains of a doll. A character who makes a successful DC 10 Intelligence (Investigation) check discovers that the doll was once a colorfully dressed Vistani effigy. Stitched into its tattered pants is a slogan: "Is No Fun, Is No Blinsky!" Rictavio isn't ready to unleash the tiger on the Vistani just yet. He feeds it by dropping wolf steaks down a 1-foot-square hatch in the wagon's roof. A character who climbs atop the wagon can spot the hatch without needing to make an ability check. If the tiger is released, it begins stalking through the streets until its keen sense of smell locates either Rictavio (area [[Blue Water Inn(N2)|N2]]) or Piccolo (area N7). The tiger doesn't attack anyone who isn't a Vistana except in self-defense. It attacks Vistani on sight. Rictavio can make the tiger break off its attack and lure it back into the wagon.

**TREASURE** 
The front seat of the wagon conceals a secret compartment that requires a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check to find and open. The compartment holds several items: 
* An unlocked wooden coffer containing so ep bearing Strahd's profile and six gemstones (worth 100 gp each).
* A small prayer book (worth 50 gp) with a green leather cover and indecipherable notes in the margins.
* A healer's kit Three wooden holy symbols inlaid with silver and in the shape of a sunburst (worth 50 gp each).
* A silvered shortsword.
* A hand crossbow inlaid with mother-of-pearl (worth 250 gp). 
* A bundle of twenty silvered crossbow bolts.
* A worn leather case with gold buckles (worth 100 gp) containing three sharpened wooden stakes, a sack of garlic, a jar of salt, a box of holy wafers, six vials of holy water, a polished steel mirror, and a bone scroll tube with a silver stopper and chain (worth 25 gp). The tube contains a spell scroll of protection from fiends and a spell scroll of protection from undead.
