You can view the map of the mansion [[#Manion Map|here]].

"This mansion has walls of plastered stone that display many scars where the plaster has fallen away from age and neglect. Drapes cover every window, including a large, arched opening above the mansion's double entrance doors."

People come and go from the mansion at all hours during the day. Guards bring criminals cited for "malicious unhappiness." Men and women arrive carrying bundles of twigs, which are piled about the mansion's grand foyer (area N3a) until the construction of the wicker sun for the Festival of the Blazing Sun gets under way. If the characters knock on the front doors, a maid (LG female human commoner) lets them in, escorts them to the den (area N3e), and leaves to fetch the baron.

ROLEPLAYING THE VALLAKOVICH FAMILY
Use the following information to roleplay the burgomaster and his family. 

**The Baron** 
The burgomaster, Baron Vargas Vallakovich (NE male human noble), is a ruthless heel who prides himself on his good breeding and finely honed leadership skills. He stages repeated celebrations to foster happiness, and his "All will be well!" catchphrase has become a sad and tiresome punchline. Baron Vallakovicb has convinced himself that if he can make everyone in Vallaki happy, the town will slip free of Strahd's dark grasp. The baron has a brittle ego, and he lashes out at anyone who pokes fun at his festivals or treats him disrespectfully. He has two pet mastiffs that follow him everywhere, as well as a murderous and deformed henchman named [[Appendix D_ Monsters and NPCs.pdf#page=8|Izek Strazni]] (see appendix D). In addition to his weapons, Izek carries an iron ring of keys that unlock the stocks in the town square (area N8). If the characters get on his bad side, the baron accuses them of being "spies of the devil Strahd" and sends twelve guards to arrest them, seize their weapons, and run them out of town. If the guards fail in their duty, the baron sends Izek to rally a mob of thirty commoners to lynch the party. If the commoners also fail, the baron summons the twelve remaining guards to defend his mansion, giving characters the run of the town. If the characters get on his good side, he insists that they join him in the next festival as special guests and asks that they tell everyone that all will, indeed, be well. 

Two members of the baron's household staff have vanished in the past week: the butler and the baroness's lady-in-waiting. The baron has charged Izek with finding out what happened to them, but investigation isn't Izek's forte. Searches have been organized, to no avail.

**The Baroness** 
At the risk of sacrificing her sanity, the baron's wife, Lydia Petrovna (LG female human commoner), has embraced her husband's philosophy of happiness. She laughs at the baron's every comment, to the extent that it has become a nervous reflex, and she tries to spread good cheer by throwing daily tea-andsandwich parties in the parlor for her "dearest friends," many of them poor folk who tolerate the baroness only because they crave something warm to eat and drink. Lydia is a gods-fearing woman and the younger sister of the-town priest, Father Lucian Petrovkh. She is a descendant of Tasha Petrovna, a priest entombed in Castle Ravenloft (area K84, crypt 11).

**The Baronet**
The baron's miserable son, Victor Vallakovich (NE male human mage), has confined himself to the attic (area N3t), where he is content to avoid the unwanted attention of his mother and the disapproving glares of his father. Years ago, Victor found an old spellbook in the mansion's library and used it to teach himself magic. He has been busy constructing a teleportation circle in the hope of escaping Barovia and leaving his parents to their doom.
## Entrance hall and vestibule(N3a)
"Framed portraits adorn the walls of this grand foyer, which features a wide staircase with a sculpted railing. A long, carpeted hall attached to the foyer stretches almost the length of the mansion and has several doors leading away from it, including one at the far end. Bundles of twigs are heaped against the walls."

The twigs are being stored here until they can be fashioned into a wooden effigy of the sun (for the Festival of the Blazing Sun). The stairs climb to the upstairs gallery (area N3i). The portraits depict the baron, his family, and their ancestors. Close inspection reveals that some of the people portrayed look very much alike. Tucked in the northeast corner of the foyer is a vestibule packed with fine cloaks, coats, and boots.

## Parlor(N3b)
"This parlor contains a fine array offurnishings and draperies, with an overall feminine touch."

The baroness sometimes entertains guests here.

## Dining room(N3c)
Characters can hear the chatter of female voices as they approach this room. The first time they peer inside, read:

"A chandelier of wrought iron fitted with wax candles hangs above a polished wooden dining table. Around the table are seated eight women of various ages in comfortable, high-backed chairs. They wear faded clothes, drink tea, and devour cake while a ninth woman, well dressed and very pleased with herself, circles the table and talks excitedly about decorations for the impending festival."

The women seated at the table are eight Vallakian peasants (LG female commoners) invited to spend time with the baroness, Lydia Petrovna, who is bribing them with tea and cake. Lydia has assigned these women the task of stitching children's costumes and weaving together a wicker sun for the Festival of the Blazing Sun. Lydia assumes that the characters are here at the invitation of her husband, the burgomaster. She calls for the maid to take them to the den (area [[#Den (N3e)|N3e]]) and then to inform Baron Vallakovich (see area N2l) that his guests have arrived. A serving table stands in one corner of the dining hall.

## Preparation room(N3d)
"White sheets cover two plain wooden tables in the center of this room. Neatly arranged atop one table is a complete set of polished silverware. The other table is covered with wicker baskets containing turnips and beets."

The beets and turnips are for the Festival of the Blazing Sun (see the "Special Events" section). 

Treasure. 
The silverware set's worth 150 gp.

## Den (N3e)
Characters who ask to see the burgomaster are brought here.

"Padded chairs and couches line the walls of this cozy, carpeted den. The room reeks of pipe smoke, and mounted on the east wall is the head of an angry-looking brown bear."

The mounted bear's head is meant to unnerve visitors. It serves as a subtle warning not to antagonize the burgomaster, who spends most of his time in the library (area N3l). Although the burgomaster claims that his father killed the bear, the head was actually a gift given to his family by the late Szoldar Grygorovich, father of the wolf hunter Szoldar Szoldarovich (area [[Blue Water Inn(N2)|N2]]).

## Servant's quarter(N3f)
"This room contains four simple beds and an equal number of plain wooden trunks."

The household staff consists of a maid (LG female human commoner) and a cook (LG male human commoner). The other two beds belonged to the butler and the baroness's lady-in-waiting, both of whom have gone missing (see area N3t). The trunks contain the staff's clothing and uniforms.

## Kitchen(N3g)
"A cook wearing a white apron over a black smock busies himself in this warm, well-appointed kitchen. A staircase in one corner climbs to the upper floor."

The staircase leads to the upstairs gallery (area N3i). A door in the west wall leads to a garden outside. The door is usually locked, and both the cook and the burgomaster carry keys to unlock it.

## Pantry(N3g)
"This pantry contains shelves of foodstuffs, although half of the shelves are bare. Two barrels of wine stand against the east wall."

The pantry has not been fully stocked for as long as anyone can remember. The two barrels contain a fine wine called Red Dragon Crush, created by the Wizard of Wines winery facts burned into the side of each barrel.

## Upstairs gallery(N3i)
If the characters arrive here from the entrance hall (area [[#Entrance hall and vestibule(N3a)|N3a]]), read:

"The staircase climbs twenty feet to a beautifully appointed gallery that continues toward the west, running almost the length of the mansion. Framed landscape paintings line the walls, and red silk drapes cover a tenfoot-tall arched window of leaded glass."

If the characters arrive here from the kitchen (area N3g), read:

"The staircase climbs to a ten-foot-wide gallery that stretches almost the length of the mansion. Breathtaking paintings of landscapes line the walls. Two separate, narrow hallways lead away from the gallery to the north."

## Izek's bedroom(N3j)
The door to this room is locked. Izek Strazni carries the only key. The following description assumes the characters have met Ireena Kolyana (area E4). If the characters haven't met her, don't read the last sentence.

"Dolls. This room is full of pretty little dolls with powder-white skin and auburn hair, some of them dressed beautifully, others plainly. Some of the dolls fill a long bookshelf, and others are arranged in neat rows on wallmounted shelves. Still others are piled atop a bed and a heavy wooden chest. What's most odd is that all of the dolls, apart from their clothing, look the same. They all look like lreena Kolyana."
