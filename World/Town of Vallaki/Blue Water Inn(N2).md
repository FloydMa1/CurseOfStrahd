For the map of the inn you can find [[#Map (N2)|here]].

"Gray smoke issues from the chimney of this large, two story wooden building with a stone foundation and sagging tile roof, upon which several ravens have perched. A painted wooden sign hanging above the main entrance depicts a blue waterfall."

The Blue Water Inn is Vallaki's main gathering place for locals, especially at night. The innkeeper, Urwin Martikov, considers the inn a sanctuary from the evils of this land. In the event of trouble the windows and doors can all be barred shut from within. A bed for the night costs 1 ep. Characters looking for something to eat are fed hot beet soup and fresli bread at no additional charge. A cooked wolf steak costs 1 ep. The inn offers a pint of Purple Grapemash No. 3 wine for 3 cp, or a pint of the superior Red Dragon Crush wine for 1 sp. Urwin is hurt if the characters complain about the wines, for his family makes them. The inn's wine supply is almost depleted, and the latest delivery from the Wizard of Wines winery is overdue. If the characters claim to be adventurers, Urwin asks them if they would be so kind as to find out what's holding up the latest shipment, promising them free room and board if they return with the wine.

KEEPERS OF THE FEATHER 
Urwin Martikov (LG male human) is a wereraven (see appendix D) and a high-ranking member of the Keepers of the Feather, a secret society of wereravens that opposes Strahd. Urwin's wife and business partner, Danika Dorakova (LG female human), is also a wereraven, as are their two sons, Brom and Bray. The boys have only 7 hit points each and, at ages eleven and nine, are too young to be effective combatants. At any given time, another 1d4 wereravens (members of the Keepers of the Feather) are present at the inn, either perched on the rooftop in raven form or huddled inside in human form. These wereravens are loyal friends of the Martikovs and help protect the inn. If the characters earn the trust of the wereravens in Vallaki, the Keepers of the Feather will watch their backs. The next time the characters get themselves in serious trouble, you can have a group of 1d4 wereravens show up to rescue or otherwise help them.

FORTUNES OF RAVENLOFT 
If your card reading reveals that a treasure is hidden at the inn, the Keepers of the Feather don't reveal where the treasure is until they know the characters are capable of protecting it. As a way of testing their abilities, Urwin gives the characters the following quest:

"Urwin takes you aside and keeps his voice low. "My supply of wine is nearly gone, and the next shipment is overdue. I'll give you what you seek if you bring me my wine. The vineyard and winery is a few miles west of here. Just follow the Old Svalich Road and the signs.""

Urwin fails to mention that his cantankerous father, Davian Martikov, owns the local winery and vineyard, the Wizard of Wines (chapter 12). There's bad blood between Urwin and his father (whom Urwin and Danika refer to as "the old crow"). Although Urwin could easily visit the winery himself, he considers dealing with his father to be a worthy test of the characters' competence, and he makes good on his promise if they complete the quest and return with his wine shipment. Urwin sends a wereraven in raven form to observe the party's progress from a distance. If the characters get in trouble, the wereraven reports to Urwin at once.

## Well(N2a)
A 3-foot-high stone rim surrounds the mouth of this 40-foot-deep, moss-lined well. The inn draws fresh water from this well.

## Outside Staircase(N2b)
A wooden staircase hugs the outer wall of the inn and leads up to guest quarters on the upper floor (areas [[#Guest rooms (N2l)|N2l]] and [[#Guest rooms (N2m)|N2m]]). The sturdy wooden door at the top of the stairs can be barred from the inside.

## Taproom (N2c)
"Damp cloaks hang from pegs in the entrance portico. The tavern is packed with tables and chairs, with narrow paths meandering between them. A bar stretches along one wall, under a balcony that can be reached by a wooden staircase that hugs the north wall. Another balcony overhangs an entrance to the east. All the windows are fitted with thick shutters and crossbars. Lanterns hanging above the bar and resting on the tables bathe the room in dull orange light and cast shadows upon the walls, most of which are adorned with wolf heads mounted on wooden plaques."

The double doors leading into the taproom can be barred shut from within. Mounted on braces and tucked into alcoves behind the bar are three wine barrels, each one three-quarters empty. Two of the barrels contain Purple Grapemash No. 3 (a cheap wine), and the third contains Red Dragon Crush (a fine wine). A brass spigot is hammered into each barrel. Danika Martikov usually tends bar while her husband busies himself in the kitchen (area [[#Kitchen (N2e)|N2e]]). Their boys, Brom and Bray, scamper about and easily get underfoot. Between dawn and noon, there are no patrons here, and the Martikovs are upstairs in their bedrooms (areas [[#Boys' bedroom(N2o)|N2o]] and [[#Master bedroom(N2p)|N2p]]) or in the attic (area [[#Secret attic(N2q)|N2q]]). From noon to dusk, the taproom holds 2d4 local patrons (LG male and female commoners). Between dusk and midnight, 2d8 Vallakians are here. In addition, one or more of the following people might be present during this time.

**Wolf Hunters**
Szoldar Szoldarovich and Yevgeni Krushkin (N male human scouts) are local hunters who frequent the Blue Water Inn. They kill wolves and sell the meat for a living, and their work is dangerous and bloody. Both men are grim and have haunted looks in their eyes. These two are dour fellows, but they seldom pass up an opportunity to earn coin. If the characters are looking for guides or information about the land of Barovia, Szoldar and Yevgeni can be of service. They aren't afraid to venture beyond Vallaki's walls during the day, and they know the woods and valley well. They're willing to serve as guides for 5 gp per day, or to provide directions to important landmarks in. exchange for free drinks. They think it's foolish to travel "this cursed realm" at night and won't do so unless their payment is exorbitant (100 gp or more). On rare occasions when he has something to say, Szoldar speaks brusquely, while Yevgeni usually parrots his friend in not so many words. Szoldar has a notch in his bow for every wolf he's killed, while Yevgeni adds a new swatch to his wolfskin cloak every time he makes a kill. Both men have families but spend most of their time together, either drowning their sorrows or hunting in the woods. Most of the wolf heads that adorn the tavern walls are the result of their handiwork.

**Wachter Brothers** 
Nikolai and Karl Wachter (N male human nobles) are brothers of noble birth. They are brash drunkards always looking for trouble, though they are smart enough not to pick fights with well-armed strangers. Their mother, Fiona Wachter (see area N4), is an influential figure in town, but her sons never talk about her. They'd rather listen to tales of the characters' harrowing adventures or hear about how the characters plan to free Vallaki from the burgomaster's madness.

**Rictavio**
The Ione guest of the Blue Water Inn at present is a colorfully dressed half elf bard who goes by the name Rictavio, a false identity adopted by the legendary vampire hunter Rudolph van Richten (see appendix D). He regales tavern patrons with stories so outrageous as to be hardly believable, yet he asserts they are true indeed. Rictavio claims to be a carnival ringmaster from a distant land. He's been staying at the inn for almost a month, taking advantage of Urwin Martikov's generosity and good nature. When he arrived, he was accompanied by a monkey named Piccolo. The monkey wasn't welcome at the inn, so Rictavio gave it to the local toymaker (see area N7). Rictavio admits to having no musical talent but manages to entertain locals nonetheless with his stories of faraway places. Twice each day, at dawn and again at dusk, he leaves the inn with a couple of apples and a cooked wolf steak wrapped in a handkerchief. He claims the food is for his portly friend, "the destitute toymaker" (area N7) and his pet monkey. In fact, the apples are for his horse Drusilla (area [[#Stable (N2f)|N2f]]), and the steak is for his captured saber-toothed tiger (area N5). During his stay at the inn, Rictavio is quietly gathering information on the Keepers of the Feather, trying to figure out the identities of all the wereravens in town. He's also trying to learn as much as he can about the Vistani, particularly the ones living in the camp just outside town (area N9). Once he concludes that they are in league with Strahd, Rictavio plans to unleash his trained saber-toothed tiger upon them, with or without the support of the wereravens. Rictavio wears a hat of disguise and a ring of mind shielding to conceal his identity. He carries an iron key that unlocks the door to his carnival wagon (area N5).

## Wine Storage(N2d)
"This hallway contains three curtained alcoves as well as a I larger area stuffed with wine barrels."

The Martikovs store their wine here. Tucked behind red curtains are three alcoves, each one containing a half-emptied wine barrel lying on its side in a wooden brace. Twelve empty wine barrels are piled two high near the door to the kitchen (area [[#Kitchen (N2e)|N2e]]). All the barrels have the Wizard of Wines name burned into them. Nine of the fifteen barrels, including two of the barrels in the curtained alcoves, have the following label burned into their sides, under the winery's name: Purple Grapemash No. 3. Six of the fifteen barrels, including one of the barrels in the curtained alcoves, have a different label: Red Dragon Crush. The double doors that lead outside can be barred shut from within.

## Kitchen (N2e)
"This room looks like the kitchen of someone who loves to cook. It has piles of pots, walls lined with utensils and shelves of ingredients, and all manner of pleasant odors. Two lanterns hang above a sturdy pine worktable in the middle of the clutter. A pot of soup bubbles on the hearth."

Urwin Martikov, who prepares most of the meals, is found here throughout the day. He occasionally receives help from his two boys, but they are easily distracted. A cupboard against the east wall holds most of the inn's supply of cutlery and dishware, none of it valuable. A door in the west wall leads outside and is usually barred from the inside. A secret door at the west end of the south wall can be pushed open to reveal a wooden staircase that leads ·
up to area [[#Secret stairs and hall (N2i)|N2i]].

## Stable (N2f)
The sliding wooden doors on the west wall of this room are held shut by an iron lock and chain. Urwin carries the key to the lock. The doors to the north and south can, be barred shut from the inside but are usually unlocked.

"You hear the squawking of birds and the plaintive whinny of a horse as you peer inside this stable. The stalls are clean and well maintained. One of them contains a gray mare. A small door is set into the east wall, and a wooden ladder gives access to a loft overhead. Perched on the wooden railing that encloses the loft are dozens of ravens."

Any character who has a horse can keep it here for 1 sp per night. The gray mare is a draft horse named Drusilla, and she likes apples. The horse belongs to Rictavio (see area [[#Taproom (N2c)|N2c]]). The small door in the east wall can be pulled open to reveal area [[#Storage (N2g)|N2g]]. The loft is described in area N2h.

## Storage (N2g)
This small room lies under a wooden staircase (area [[#Secret stairs and hall (N2i)|N2i]]). Hanging from wooden pegs are saddles and barding to equip two horses. In an unlocked wooden chest are a dozen horseshoes, a wooden mallet, and a mound of horseshoe nails.

## Ravens' Loft (N2h)
"Dim light spilling in through a pair of dirt-encrusted windows reveals piles of hay with pitchforks sticking out of them. Ravens rule this roost-you can see hundreds of them."

Characters who search the loft thoroughly find three pitchforks and a locked wooden chest buried under a pile of hay (see "Treasure" below), next to a secret door. If the characters tamper with the chest, the ravens gather into four swarms of ravens and attack. If two swarms are killed, the others flee. Otherwise, they cease their attacks if the characters leave the chest alone. If the fighting continues for more than 3 rounds, Urwin Martikov and two other wereravens hear the ruckus and investigate (in human form). A secret door in the back of the loft can be pushed open to reveal a bedchamber (area [[#Master bedroom(N2p)|N2p]]) beyond. No ability check is required to spot the secret door, because light in the room beyond slips through the door's cracks.

**Treasure** 
Inside the locked chest are 140 sp, 70 pp, two elixirs of health, three potions of healing, and a gray bag of tricks. The coins are embossed with the profiled likeness of Strahd von Zarovich.

## Secret stairs and hall (N2i)
"A wooden staircase to the north descends fifteen feet to a landing. A window dimly illuminates a short, wood-paneled hallway that runs west to east."

Guests arent told about the inn's secret hallway. Rictavio knows of its existance because he has heard the Martikov boys opening and closing the secret door closest to his room (area [[#Private guest room (N2n)|N2n]]). At each end of this area is a secret door, each of which is easy to spot from inside the hallway (no ability check required). The northern secret door, at the bottom of the staircase, can be pulled open to reveal the kitchen (area [[#Kitchen (N2e)|N2e]]]) beyond. The eastern secret door can be pulled open to reveal a balcony (area [[#Great Balcony (N2j)|N2j]]) that overlooks the taproom.

## Great Balcony (N2j)
"A wooden balcony stretches the full length of the taproom, enclosed by a wooden railing carved with raven motifs. The taproom's many lanterns illuminate the rafters and cast ominous shadows on the peaked ceiling."

The balcony floor is 15 feet above the taproom floor. A secret door at the south end of the western wall can be pushed open to reveal a wood-paneled hallway (area [[#Secret stairs and hall (N2i)|N2i]]) beyond.

## Guest Balcony (N2k)
"This twenty-foot-long balcony provides a clear view of the bar and has a wooden railing carved with raven motifs. The taproom's many lanterns illuminate the rafters and cast ominous shadows on the peaked ceiling."

The balcony floor is 15 feet above the taproom floor.

## Guest rooms (N2l)
These two rooms have identical furnishings.

"Two cozy beds with matching footlockers rest in the far corners of this fifteen-foot-square room. Wolf furs are heaped atop each bed. Between the beds, a lamp sits on a table under a shuttered window. Two tall black wardrobes stand against the wall by the door."

The door to this room can be locked from the inside, and each guest gets a key. Urwin and Danika carry spare keys. The footlockers and wardrobes are empty and are for the use of guests.

## Guest rooms (N2m)
"Four plain beds with straw mattresses line the north wall of this well-lit room. Each bed comes with a matching footlocker to store clothing and other belongings. A table and four chairs occupy the corner across from the door. An oil lamp resting on the table casts a bright yellow flame."

The door to this room can be locked from the inside, and each guest receives a key. Urwin and Danika carry spare keys. The footlockers are empty and are for the use of guests.

## Private guest room (N2n)
Rictavio has a key to this room, which is locked at all times. Urwin and Danika carry spare keys. The door's Jock can be picked, but discretion is called for because the door is in plain view of the taproom below.

"This small guest room contains a bed heaped with wolf furs, a footlocker, a tall wardrobe, and a writing desk with matching chair. An oil lamp rests atop the desk near a journal bound in a red leather jacket."

Rictavio sleeps here between midnight and dawn. At dawn, he leaves to check on his horse (area [[#Stable (N2f)|N2f]]) and his wagon (area N5), returning to the inn around noon. Between noon and dusk, there's a 40 percent chance he is here; otherwise, he's in the taproom (area [[#Taproom (N2c)|N2c]]). At dusk, he leaves the inn to tend to his horse and his wagon again, then returns to his room to retire for the night. Rictavio is too clever to leave anything valuable or incriminating in his room. The footlocker and the wardrobe contain nothing but common clothes and travel wear.

**Rictavio'sjournal** 
The journal on the desk is a bit of artifice that Rictavio created to perpetuate the illusion that he is an entertainer in search of new acts for his traveling carnival. His writing makes frequent mention of conversations with Drusilla (which the journal fails to mention is the name of Rictavio's horse) and recounts many long and tedious journeys by wagon. Rictavio has also written about various "oddities" he has seen in his travels, including the following:
* A "werehare" child (a boy who transforms into a rabbit on nights of the full moon).
* A half-ore woman named Gorabacha who could chew through iron chains.
* A giant, man-eating plant that had the most remarkable singing voice
* A pair of conjoined goblins
* A small man with no legs named Filmore Stunk, who could drink whole casks of wine without getting drunk.

## Boys' bedroom(N2o)
"A large, painted toy box rests between two small, cozy beds. Murals of ravens in flight are painted on the walls above the wood paneling."

Brom and Bray Martikova don't spend much time in this room. The toy box contains a pile of neglected toys, many of them etched with the slogan: "Is No Fun, Is No Blinky!" The toys include the following:
* A miniature puppet theater with appropriately sized marionette of a king, a queen, a prince, a princess, an executioner, a tax collector, a dunce, a vampire, and a vampire hunter.
* A garish toy Vistani wagon hitched to a wooden horse and filled with tiny wooden Vistani figures.
* A pair of painted wooden clown masks, one displaying a mean scowl and the other a frightened expression.
* A wooden top painted with images of scarecrows chasing children through the forest.
* A stuffed (real) bat on puppet strings.

A hidden trapdoor in the 8-foot-high ceiling opens into a secret attic (area [[#Secret attic(N2q)|N2q]]).

## Master bedroom(N2p)
"Matching end tables flank a large wood-framed bed with a red silk canopy. Across from the bed hangs a tapestry depicting a beautiful mountain valley. The other walls are dominated by a fireplace and a wardrobe."

Urwin and Danika retire to this room every night before heading to the attic (area [[#Secret attic(N2q)|N2q]]) to sleep. This room is for appearances only and contains no valuables. A secret door at the west end of the south wall can be pulled open to reveal the loft beyond (area [[#Ravens' Loft (N2h)|N2h]]). A hidden trapdoor in the 8-foot-high ceiling opens into a secret attic (area [[#Secret attic(N2q)|N2q]]).

## Secret attic(N2q)
"This ten-foot-wide, thirty-five-foot-long attic has a ceiling that slants down toward the west, dropping from a height of eight feet to a height of five feet. Four straw nests cover the floor, and a locked iron strongbox sits against the north wall. A small square opening in the south wall leads outside. Two trapdoors with iron hinges are set into the floor."

The Martikovs sleep here at night in hybrid form. The opening in the south wall is just big enough for a raven or other Tiny creature to pass through. The wereravens can use this opening as an escape route. The strongbox is described in "Treasure" below. Two trapdoors, clearly visible on the floor, can be pulled open to reveal the headchambers (areas [[#Boys' bedroom(N2o)|N2o]] and [[#Master bedroom(N2p)|N2p]]) that lie directly beneath them.
