## Blinksy Toy
A Blinsky toy is encountered only if the characters are moving about the castle (not resting); otherwise, treat this result as no encounter.

"You find a discarded toy-something no child could love."

The toy has a slogan stitched or printed on it in tiny letters: "Is No Fun, Is No Blinsky!" Roll a d6 to determine the specific toy:

| d6 | Toy | 
| ----------- | ----------- | 
| 1 | A plush werewolf stuffed with sawdust and tiny wood-carved babies. It has dull knife blades for claws and retractable teeth. |
| 2 | A smiling jester marionette with tangled strings and tiny copper bells sewn into its cap. |
| 3 | A wooden puzzle box, 6 inches on a side, carved with silhouettes of leering clown faces. The box rattles when shaken. A character who spends a short rest fiddling with the box can figure out how to open it with a successful DC 20 Intelligence check. The box is empty, with nothing inside to explain the rattling. |
| 4 | A faceless doll in a wedding dress that has yellowed and frayed with age. |
| 5 | A vaguely coffin-shaped jack-in-the-box containing a pop-up Strahd puppet. |
| 6 | A spring-loaded set of wooden teeth with fangs, all painted white. The teeth gnash and chatter for 1 minute when the spring is wound tight (requiring an action) and released. |

## Unseen Servant
"A curious object drifts into view, as though held aloft by an invisible force."

This unseen servant was created by Strahd and is permanent until destroyed. Roll a d6 to determine what the servant is carrying, or choose one of the options below.

| d6 | Item | 
| ----------- | ----------- | 
| 1 | A tarnished silver platter with a lid (worth 25 gp). If a character comes within S feet of the servant, it lifts the lid, revealing a bunch of moldy scones. The first character to eat a scone gains inspiration. On later occurrences of this encounter, the platter holds a crawling claw that attacks the nearest character. |
| 2 | A silver goblet (worth SO gp) filled to the brim with wine. A character who drinks the wine must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 44 (8d10) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. On future occurrences of this encounter, the wine acts as a potion of healing. |
| 3 | A gold candelabrum (worth 150 gp) with three branches, each one holding an unlit candle. |
| 4 | A purple silk handkerchief with white ruffled edges (worth l gp). On future occurrences of this encounter, the handkerchief is smeared with fresh blood. |
| 5 | A crystal dinner bell (worth 25 gp). The unseen servant rings the bell if the characters come within 10 feet of it. The sound attracts 1d4 hungry vampire spawn , which arrive in 1d4+1 rounds. |
| 6 | A wizard's spell book with a black velvet dust jacket over its stitched leather cover. The book contains all the spells Strahd has prepared (see appendix D). On subsequent occurrences of this encounter, the tome is a nonmagical leather-bound storybook worth 25 gp. |

## Crawling Claws
A mob of severed hands, their mummified Aesh black with soot, skitters out of the darkness across the dusty Aoor.

The crawling claws gang up on one party member. During the confusion, one of the claws tries to crawl into the character's backpack and hide there. It makes a Dexterity (Stealth) check contested by the character's passive Wisdom (Perception) score. If the claw loses the contest, the character sees the claw enter the backpack. If the claw wins the contest, it waits until the character takes a long rest before scuttling out to attack.
