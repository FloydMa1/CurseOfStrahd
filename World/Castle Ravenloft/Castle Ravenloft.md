CASTLE RAVENLOFT was built atop the ruin of an older fortress by artisans, wizards, and workers loyal to Strahd's family. Strahd rewarded the castle's genius architect, Artimus, with a crypt in the castle's catacombs. The castle was named after Strahd's mother, Ravenovia, who also lies entombed below. The poster map that accompanies this book displays the castle in its entirety. Map 1 on the poster shows a diagram of the castle's face, and the other maps show the castle's interior and exterior areas. 

The whole layout and explanations for the Castle are divided into the next few sections:
* [[Walls of Ravenloft]]
* [[Main Floor]]
* [[Court of the Count]]
* [[Rooms of Weeping]]
* [[Spires of Ravenloft]]
* [[Larders of Ill Omen]]
* [[Dungeon and Catacombs]]
