## Old Svalich Road(A)

 "Black pools of water stand like dark mirrors in and around the muddy roadway. Giant trees loom on both sides of the road, their branches clawing at the mist." 
 
 This is the start of the road where the players find themselves at the beginning of the "Creeping Fog" Hook. This dirt road leads to [[#The Gates of Barovia(B)]]. 

## The Gates of Barovia(B)

"The fog spills out of the forest to swallow up the road behind you. Ahead, jutting from the impenetrable woods on both sides of the road, are high stone buttresses looming gray in the fog. Huge iron gates hang on the stonework. Dew clings with cold tenacity to the rusted bars. Two headless statues of armed guardians flank the gate, their heads now lying among the weeds at their feet. They greet you only with silence."

These are the gates to Barovia the one the players arrive at is the East gate, but there is also a gate to the West of the town.

If the players arrive on foot the gates creek open with a heavy thud. The gates close behind the characters after they pass through. If the characters are riding in Vistani wagons, the gates open in front of the lead wagon and close when the rear one has entered. The eastern gates don't open for people trying to leave Strahd's domain unless they are accompanied by Vistani. The fog chokes any non-Vistani that passes through the gates or skirts around them when they are closed (see "Mists of Raven loft" earlier in this chapter). If Strahd is defeated, the gates of Barovia swing open, and the road east becomes clear of fog.

## The Svalich Woods(C)

"Towering trees, whose tops are lost in heavy gray mist, block out all but a death-gray light. The tree trunks are unnaturally close to one another, and the woods have the silence of a forgotten grave, yet exude the feeling of an unvoiced scream."

If the characters are traveling in Vistani wagons, they can continue on to [[The village of Barovia|the village of Barovia (E)]] without incident.

If the characters are following the road on foot, the party member who has the highest passive Wisdom(Perception) score notices something: "You catch the scent of death on the air."

The character can follow the stench to its source: "The foul scent leads you to a human corpse half-buried in the underbrush about fifteen feet from the road. The young man appears to be a commoner. His muddy clothes are torn and raked with claw marks. Crows have been at the body, which is surrounded by paw prints. The man has obviously been dead for several days. He holds a crumpled envelope in one hand."

The dead man, Dalvan Olensky, was trying to escape from Barovia with a letter from his master when he was killed on the road by Strahd's dire wolves. Wanting to return at once to Strahd, the wolves left the body in the woods but have not yet returned to feast. The letter in Dalvan's hand has a large "B" set into its wax seal. The parchment is worn and flimsy. If the characters open and read the letter, show the players [[Kolyan lndirovich's Letter (VERSION 2).png|"Kolyan Indirovich's Letter (Version 2)" in Appendix F]]. The letter is dated one week ago. Dalvan was instructed to place the letter at the gates, in the hope that visitors would find it and turn back. 

If the characters linger in the woods, they hear a lone wolf howl far off in the forest. Each round, one more wolf adds its voice to the howling, with the sound getting progressively closer to the party. If the characters are still in the woods after 5 rounds of howling, five dire wolves arrive and attack. If the characters are trying to leave Barovia, these dire wolves are joined by a pack of twenty wolves. The wolves and the dire wolves stop their attack if the characters return to the road and head toward [[The village of Barovia|the village of Barovia (E)]].

## River Ivlis(D)
When the characters come within sight of this river for the first time, read: "This river flows as clear as a blue winter sky through."

The river is roughly 50 feet wide, with a depth ranging from 5 to 10 feet. Arching stone bridges span the river at two points, one near [[the village of Barovia]] and the other near Tser Falls (area H).

## The village of Barovia(E)
The village of Barovia is the saddest place in the land, its residents so terrified of Strahd that they rarely venture from their homes. The village lies in the shadow of Castle Raven loft, buried under fog but still unable to hide from the vampire's sight. Until recently, Strahd had been paying nightly visits to lreena Kolyana, the adopted daughter of the village burgomaster. Ireena carries the soul of Strahd's beloved Tatyana and looks exactly like her. Strahd intends to make Ireena his bride, turn her into a vampire, and lock her away in the castle crypts for all time.

## River Ivlis Crossroads(F)
Check for a random encounter whenever the characters reach area F, unless they are accompanied by Vistani.

"An old wooden gallows creaks in a chill wind that blows down from the high ground to the west. A frayed length of rope dances from its beam. The well-worn road splits here, and a signpost opposite the gallows points off in three directions: [[The village of Barovia|BAROVIA VILLAGE]] to the east, [[Tser Pool Encampment|TSER Pool]] to the northwest, and RAVENLOFT/VALLAKI to the southwest. The northwest fork slants down and disappears into the trees, while the southwest fork clings to an upward slope. Across from the gallows, a low wall, crumbling in places, partially encloses a small plot of graves shrouded in fog."

The northwest fork leads down to the river and [[#Tser Pool Encampment(G)|area G]]. The road southwest leads to area H. The east road leads to an arching stone bridge and continues on to [[The village of Barovia|the village of Barovia (area E)]]. 

If the characters are traveling with Vistani, the Vistani leads them along the northwest
road to the Vistani encampment. The gallows stand atop a rotting platform 5 feet high, with wooden stairs leading up to it. Eleven graves are here with blank gravestones. The forgotten people buried here were hanged from the gallows. Characters who dig up the graves find rotted coffins containing moldy bones.

As the characters leave the area, read: "You hear a creaking noise behind you, coming from the gallows. Where there was nothing before now hangs a lifeless, gray body. The breeze turns the hanged figure slowly so that it can fix its dead eyes upon you."

One random character sees him- or herself hanging from the gallows. The other characters see an unfamiliar Barovian. The corpse looks and smells real, and it rapidly melts away into nothing if touched or moved. 

## Tser Pool Encampment(G)
"The road gradually disappears and is replaced by a twisted, muddy path through the trees. Deep ruts in the earth are evidence of the comings and goings of wagons. The canopy of mist and branches suddenly gives way to black clouds boiling far above. There is a clearing here, next to a river that widens to form a small lake several hundred feet across. Five colorful round tents, each ten feet in diameter, are pitched outside a ring of four barrel-topped wagons. A much larger tent stands near the shore of the lake, its sagging form lit from within. Near this tent, eight unbridled horses drink from the river. The mournful strains of an accordion clash with the singing of several brightly clad figures around a bonfire. A footpath continues beyond this encampment, meandering north between the river and the forest's edge."

For more information click on [[Tser Pool Encampment]].

## Tser Falls(H)
If the characters reach area H by following the footpath from the Vistani encampment [[Tser Pool Encampment|(area G)]], read: "You follow the river to the base of a canyon, at the far end of which a great waterfall spills into a pool, billowing forth clouds of cold mist. A great stone bridge spans the canyon nearly one thousand feet overhead."

If the characters are on the high road instead, read: "You follow the dirt road as it clings to the side of a mountain and ends before an arching bridge of mold-encrusted stone that spans a natural chasm. Gargoyles cloaked in black moss perch on the corners of the bridge, their frowns weatherworn. On the mountainous side of the bridge, a waterfall spills into a misty pool nearly a thousand feet below. The pool feeds a river that meanders into the fog-shrouded pines that blanket the valley."

The chasm's walls are slippery and sheer, and can't be scaled without the aid of magic or a climber's kit. The bridge is slick with moisture but safe to cross. The road south of the bridge leads down the mountainside to [[#River Ivlis Crossroads(F)|area F]]; the road north cuts through the mountains to [[#Black Carriage(I)|area I]]. The gargoyles on the bridge are harmless sculptures.

## Black Carriage(I)
"Even here, in the mountains, the forest and the fog are inescapable. Ahead, the dirt road splits in two, widening toward the east. There you see patches of cobblestone, suggesting that the eastern branch was once an important thoroughfare."

If Strahd has invited the characters to Castle Ravenloft or otherwise wants to steer them in his direction, add: "Parked at the fork in the road, pointed east, is a large black carriage drawn by two black horses. The horses snort puffs of steamy breath into the chill mountain air. The side door of the carriage swings open silently."

The two black draft horses are under Strahd's control. The horses wait for the characters to pile into the carriage if they so desire. There is room inside for eight of them. If they get into the carriage, the horses draw it down the road to area. The horses can't be discouraged from their course, not even by a skilled teamster. Characters who don't want to travel east in the carriage can follow the road northwest through a set of iron gates [[#The Gates of Barovia(B)|(area B)]] that open as they approach and close behind them, or the characters can travel south along the winding road to the bridge at [[#Tser Falls(H)|Tser Falls (area H)]].

## Gates of Ravenloft(J)
The following text assumes that the characters arrive here in the carriage from [[#Black Carriage(I)|area I]]. Modify the text as needed if the characters arrive by another means.

"After winding through the forest and craggy mountain peaks, the road takes a sudden turn to the east, and the startling, awesome presence of Castle Ravenloft towers before you. The carriage comes to a dead stop before twin turrets of stone, broken from years of exposure. Beyond these guard towers is the precipice of a fifty-foot-wide, fog-filled chasm that disappears into unknown depths. A lowered drawbridge of old, shored-up wooden beams stretches across the chasm, between you and the archway to the courtyard. The chains of the drawbridge creak in the wind, their rust-eaten iron straining under the weight. From atop the high walls, stone gargoyles stare at you out of their hollow eye sockets and grin hideously. A rotting wooden portcullis, green with growth, hangs above the entry tunnel. Beyond this location, the main doors of Raven loft stand open. A rich, warm light spills from within, flooding the courtyard. Torches flutter sadly in sconces on both sides of the open doors."

The drawbridge appears sturdy, but a few of its boards are missing and it creaks and groans under any weight. Each time a creature other than strahd or a horse that draws his carriage crosses the drawbridge, there is a 5 percent chance of one of its boards breaking under the
creature. If a board breaks, the creature must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or fall to the bottom of the cliffs, 1,000 feet below. If a companion is within 5 feet of the creature and reaches out to grab it, the creature has advantage on the save.

GREEN SLIME
A patch of [[Dungeon Master's Guide.pdf#page=105|green slime]] clings to the portcullis in the entry tunnel, and can be spotted with a successful DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check. The slime will not fall on characters entering the castle, but it does fall on the first character who leaves by this route.

## Castle Ravenloft(K)
Exploring Castle Ravenloft, the lair of the vampire Strahd von Zarovich.

Full details [[Castle Ravenloft|here]]

## Lake Zarovich(L)
"At the foot of a mountain, nestled in the misty forest, is a large lake. The water is perfectly still and dark, reflecting the black clouds overhead like a monstrous mirror."

If the characters arrive along the shore north of Vallaki in the daytime, add: "Pulled up along the south shore are three small rowboats. A fourth boat can be seen in the middle of the lake, with a lone figure sitting in it, fishing pole in hand."

Each rowboat can safely hold five people. The person fishing on the lake is [[Bluto Krogarov]] (NE male human [[Monsters and Creatures#Commoner|commoner]]), a resident of Vallaki. He is in a trance and doesn't respond to anything or anyone unless attacked. His boat is 400 feet from the nearest shore. Tied up in the boat is a seven-year-old Vistana named Arabelle (LN female human [[Monsters and Creatures#Commoner|commoner]] with 2 hit points and no effective attacks). She is bound with hempen rope, wrapped in a burlap sack, and lying prone so that she can't be seen or heard from the shore.

Characters who act quickly can save Arabelle before she drowns. A character on the shore must succeed on a DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check to reach her in time. The DC is 10 for characters who took a rowboat out onto the lake. Arabelle has alabaster-white skin and raven-black hair. If rescued, she demands to be returned to her family's camp outside Vallaki (chapter 5, area N9). She is certain that her father, Luvash, will give the characters a reward for doing so. A descendant of Madam Eva with the blood of Barovian royalty in her veins, Arabelle is unaware of her connection to Strahd. She acts more like an adult than a child. Despite her recent misadventure, she believes that a great destiny awaits her.

## Mad Mage of Mount Barok(M)
This encounter can occur anywhere along the base of Mount Baratok.

"North of the mountain lake, the trees begin their steady climb up the slopes of Mount Baratok, its monolithic presence oppressive at this distance. The ground here is rocky, uneven, and tiring to navigate. Even the wolves avoid this neck of the woods. Soon, you climb above the blanket of fog that engulfs the valley. Dark thunderclouds roll overhead. You see an elk standing on a rocky spur about sixty feet away. Suddenly, it assumes the form of a man in tattered black robes. His hair and beard are long, black, and streaked with gray, and his eyes crackle with eldritch power."

The Mad Mage of Mount Baratok (CN male human archmage) came to Barovia more than a year ago to free its people from Strahd's tyranny, but he underestimated Strahd's hold over the land and the creatures in it. After a battle between the two in Castle Ravenloft, Strahd drove the Mad Mage to the mountains and sent the wizard hurling over Tser Falls (area H). The wizard, his staff and spellbook lost, survived the fall and retreated into the mountains, hoping to regain his power, only to be driven mad by the realization that he no longer has any hope of defeating Strahd or freeing the people of the vampire's damned realm.

## Town Of Vallaki(N)
LOCATED CLOSE TO THE SHORES OF LAKE Zarovich, the town of Vallaki (pronounced vah-/ah-key) seems like a safe haven against the evils of the Svalich Woods, if not Strahd himself. The town lies beyond the sight of Castle Ravenloft and doesn't, at first blush, seem as depressed (or oppressed) as the village of Barovia farther east. Characters who spend time in Vallaki, however, quickly realize that there is no happiness here, only false hope-which Strahd himself cultivates.

## Old Bonegrinder(O)
ONCE A GRAIN MILL THAT SERVED VALLAKI, this slouching windmill is now home to three night hags: Morgantha and her wretched daughters, Bella Sunbane and Offalia Wormwiggle. The hags are trapped in Barovia, but they like it here. Using their Change Shape action to look like Barovian woman's frumpy mother and her two homely daughters, the hags snatch children, devour them, and use the windmill's grindstone to crush their little bones into powder. This powder is a key ingredient in the hags' dream pastries, which they offer to Barovian adults who are desperate to escape Strahd's domain. Made with the bones of the innocent, the hags' dream
pastries allow Barovians to enter a trance, wherein they can escape to heavenly places full of joy. When adults can no longer afford the hag's dream pastries, the hags offer to trade their pastries for the Barovians' children, thus preying on the adults' selfishness while acquiring the ingredients they need to make more pastries. This is how the hags sow corruption in Strahd's domain and why they don't take the children by force. The hags are interested only in children who have souls. They prick each child with a needle; if the child cries, that's a sign that the infant has a soul.

## Luna River Crossroads(P)
Always check for a random encounter when the characters reach [[#Luna River Crossroads(P)|area P]] in their travels.

"The road comes to an X intersection, with branches to the northwest, northeast, southwest, and southeast. The lower half of a snapped wooden signpost thrusts upward at an angle near the eastern elbow of the intersection. The top half of the sign, featuring arms pointing in four directions, lies in the weeds nearby."

The characters can easily figure out how the top half of the signpost connects to the lower half. When the two parts of the sign are aligned and rejoined, the arms indicate KREZK and TSOLENKA PASS to the southwest, LAKE BARATOK to the northwest, [[Town Of Vallaki|VALLAKI]] and [[Castle Ravenloft|RAVENLOFT]] to the northeast, and BEREZ to the southeast. [[#Old Svalich Road(A)|The Old Svalich Road]], which runs northeast to southwest between [[Town Of Vallaki|Vallaki]] and Krezk, is generally level. About a quarter mile along the northeast branch, an arching stone bridge crosses the Luna River. The northwest branch of the crossroads climbs gently, becoming a dirt trail through the woods within half a mile. It merges with the Old Svalich Road again after a couple of miles, but not before sprouting a branch that leads to Van Richten's tower on Lake Baratok (area V). The southeast branch wends gently downward as it follows the river into a valley. This trail eventually ends at the mostly abandoned riverside burg of Berez (area U).

## Argynvostholt(Q)
Here, are details of the ruined mansion Argynvostholt, once a refuge of the Order of the Silver Dragon, which opposed Strahd and failed.

## Raven Rivier Crossroads(R)
Always check for a random encounter whenever the characters reach area R. This stretch of the Old Svalich Road has multiple branches. One branch heads north, quickly turning into a dirt path that leads to Van Richten's Tower on Lake Baratok (area V). One branch heads south, becoming Tsolenka Pass (area T) as it winds through the lower mountains and clings to the side of Mount Ghakis. A third branch heads west toward the Wizard of Wines winery and vineyard (area W), dipping south as it changes from a road into a gravel trail. Standing at the intersection of the Old Svalich Road and the road to the winery is a signpost:

"You see a weatherworn signpost next to the road. The three arms of the sign point along the three branches of the road. The arm pointing north reads KREZK, and through the woods, you can see an arching stone bridge spanning a river. The arm pointing east reads VALLAKI, and the road slopes up gradually in that direction. The arm pointing southwest reads THE WiZARD OF WiNES. The road slopes gently downward in that direction."
