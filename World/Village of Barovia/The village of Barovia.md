The village of Barovia is the saddest place in the land, its residents so terrified of Strahd that they rarely venture from their homes. The village lies in the shadow of Castle Raven loft, buried under fog but still unable to hide from the vampire's sight. Until recently, Strahd had been paying nightly visits to lreena Kolyana, the adopted daughter of the village burgomaster. Ireena carries the soul of Strahd's beloved Tatyana and looks exactly like her. Strahd intends to make Ireena his bride, turn her into a vampire, and lock her away in the castle crypts for all time.

Approaching the village: "Tall shapes loom out of the dense fog that surrounds everything. The muddy ground underfoot gives way to slick, wet cobblestones. The tall shapes become recognizable as village dwellings. The windows of each house stare out from pools of blackness. No sound cuts the silence except for mournful sobbing that echoes through the streets from a distance."

The sobbing comes from [[Mad Mary's Townhouse (E3)|Mad Mary's townhouse (E3)]]. With the exception of areas [[Bildrath's Mercantile (E1)]] and [[Blood of the Vine Tavern (E2)|E2]], all the shops in the village are permanently closed, and the unoccupied shops have been looted for anything valuable. Claw marks cover most of the walls. When the fog eventually burns off, Castle Ravenloft looms over the village, like a lance piercing the sky.

House Occupants
If the characters explore a residence other than [[Mad Mary's Townhouse (E3)|Mad Mary's townhouse (E3)]] or the [[Burgomaster's Mansion (E4)|burgomaster's mansion (E4)]], roll a d20 and consult the following table to determine the house's occupants.

| d20 | Occupants | 
| ----------- | ----------- | 
| 1 - 3 | 2d4 Strahd zombies |
| 4 - 8 | Barovian villagers |
| 9 - 16 | 2d4 swarms of rats |
| 17 - 20 | None |

RATS 
A house infested with rats looks abandoned. The rats are servants of Strahd and attack if the characters explore the interior of the house. 

BAROVIAN VILLAGERS 
A house of Barovian villagers is home to 1d4 adults (LG male and female human commoners) and 1d8 - 1 children (LG male and female non-combatants). Characters who listen at the door hear low, muffled whispers from within. These villagers aren't interested in speaking with strangers and never attack first, always fleeing from danger if possible. At night they cower by candlelight and keep makeshift holy symbols close at hand. 

STRAHD ZOMBIES 
When the characters open a door or a shuttered window of a house infested with Strahd zombies, they are assailed by the stench of death. If the characters dare to enter, the zombies converge on their location.
