The eight draft horses drinking from the river are used to pull the Vistani wagons and aren't easily startled. 

If the characters are brought to this camp by the Vistani, their escorts remain at the camp and don't accompany the adventuring party any farther. Twelve Vistani (CN male and female human bandits) are standing and sitting around the fire, telling stories and guzzling wine. They are intoxicated and have disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks. Three sober Vistani (CN male and female human bandit captains) are resting in three of the four wagons but leap quickly into action if an alarm is raised. Although the Vistani in this camp are in league with Strahd, they attack only if the characters provoke them with threats or insults. Otherwise, the characters are offered flasks of wine and invited to join the reverie. 

If the characters linger at the camp, continue with "[[#A Vistana's Tale]]" below. If they seem in a hurry to leave, one of the Vistani tells them, "It was fated that you would visit our humble camp. Madam Eva foretold your coming. She awaits you." The Vistana then points to the largest tent. If the characters head that way, continue with "[[#Madam Eva's Tent]]."

## A Vistana's Tale
If the characters linger by the fire, one of the Vistani recounts the following tale: "A mighty wizard came to this land over a year ago. I remember him like it was yesterday. He stood exactly where you're standing. A very charismatic man, he was. He thought he could rally the people of Barovia against the devil Strahd. He stirred them with thoughts of revolt and bore them to the castle en masse. When the vampire appeared, the wizard's peasant army fled in terror. A few stood their ground and were never seen again. The wizard and the vampire cast spells at each other. Their battle flew from the courtyards of Ravenloft to a precipice overlooking the falls. I saw the battle with my own eyes. Thunder shook the mountainside, and great rocks tumbled down upon the wizard, yet by his magic he survived. Lightning from the heavens struck the wizard, and again he stood his ground. But when the devil Strahd fell upon him, the wizard's magic couldn't save him. I saw him thrown a thousand feet to his death. I climbed down to the river to search for the wizard's body, to see if, you know, he had anything of value, but the River lvlis had already spirited him away."

The Vistana storyteller doesn't remember the wizard's name but recalls that it sounded important. If the characters haven't spoken with Madam Eva, the storyteller urges them to do so.
## Madam Eva's Tent
If the characters decide to see Madam Eva, read: "Magic flames cast a reddish glow over the interior of this tent, revealing a low table covered in a black velvet cloth. Glints of light seem to flash from a crystal ball on the table as a hunched figure peers into its depths. As the crone speaks, her voice crackles like dry weeds. "At last you have arrived!" Cackling laughter bursts like mad lightning from her withered lips."

Madam Eva (see appendix D) speaks the name of each party member and makes some reference to that individual's past deeds. She has met a good many adventurers in her time and knows they can't be fully trusted. She wants to free the land of Barovia from its curse, and her fate is interwoven with Strahd's (see [[Appendix D; Monsters and NPCs.pdf#page=233|appendix D]] for details). She does the vampire's bidding when called upon and does nothing to anger Strahd or bring harm to the Vistani. She never gives aid and never asks for any.

If the characters enter the tent read: "A sourceless voice enters your minds as you see an old shriveled lady sitting behind a beautifully maroon red dressed table. "Ahh, my destined ones. Enter and listen." You recognize the voice as the one from your dreams but you do not see the old lady speak or move her mouth. As a moment passes and you enter the old lady's mouth opens and you hear the same voice once again as she looks at Zinyra: "Zinyra, come from afar. some time ago an accident led you to your purpose." As she turns her head to Aromorn: "The young one, always cared for always loved. But raised not by his parents but by your caretaker's  love." She turns Towards Ferris: "A cleric wishing to be a wizard but finding divination instead. Your rise is yet to come" She slowly turns towards Micheal as she speaks: "Micheal, a young man seeking nothing but his own strength. Your eyes closed towards proof. Your parents gone to soon." The room coming to a quiet." 

If someone wants to say something this is their time otherwise read: "You all have a destiny, one I am here to tell. One day ago I drew this card from my deck, and four more disappeared. These cards speak of the destiny that awaits you."

If the players show their cards read: "Ahhh, so you are the ones meant to defy all odds and defeat the darkness. Let me see the cards..."

If the players don't show their cards they magically appear in Madame Eva's hand as she speaks once more. Read [[Card Reading Results]].
